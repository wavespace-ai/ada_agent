# Contributing to ADA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ADA! We want to make this framework as robust and capable as possible.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues].
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Pull Requests
- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!

## Convention

- We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
- Follow PEP 8 standards.
- Use meaningful variable names (`user_input` instead of `ui`).

## Adding New Skills
To add a new skill to ADA:
1. Create a new file in `skills/<category>/`.
2. Follow the existing skill structure (define `name`, `description`, `instructions`).
3. Submit a PR.

Thanks!
